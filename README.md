# CS50W Project 1

# Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I built a book review website called 'BooksProject' with the following functionalities/features;

- Registration and login

- Search: I implemented a search program where users can search for books using title, author, isbn. 

- API: Made API request to Goodreads API to get books reviews and another to Open Library to get book covers using Book's ISBN. I also created my own API for users to access and query for books using ISBN.
